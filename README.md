## Peer Extension : Twitter Data with PySpark
### Do "Possibly Sensitive" Labels Increase Tweet Reach?  

### Introduction
Recently, [it was shown]( https://github.com/lisapaige/Tweet-for-Reach ) among a collection of 214,936 French tweets from 2017 < during the Macron, Le Pen presidential election> that tweets that were marked as ‘possibly sensitive’ and ‘True’ were significantly more likely to have a larger retweet count as compared to tweets marked as possibly sensitive and ‘False.’ 

Assuming possibly sensitive tweets are more likely to have a higher retweet count to be the case among this particular data set, then understanding, or at least eliminating possible reasons for ‘What’ or ‘Why’ this is the case among these tweets, could be explored* 

*This is primary an exercise in working with nested .json files in PySpark. The results can only be considered relevant to this data set.
  
 ### Tech Stack
 A Docker image containing Apache Spark and PySpark were used. A pre-built* container can be obtained [from Dockerhub]( https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/pyspark-notebook ). 
 #### *certain updates and packages would need to be installed to fully replicate this project
